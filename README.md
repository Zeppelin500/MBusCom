## Documentation

The **MBusCom** library enables Arduino devices to communicate with M-Bus Slaves thru a M-Bus Master (level converter) at the Data Link Layer

Tested at ESPs, additional platforms will be supported in the future.

Together with the [**MBusinoLib**](https://github.com/Zeppelin500/MBusinoLib), you can build a M-Bus Master for reading out M-Bus Slaves.

## API

### Class: `MBusCom`

Include and instantiate the MBusCom class. The constructor takes the Serial Interface and UART Pins.

```c

MBusCom(HardwareSerial *MbusSerial, uint8_t rxPin, uint8_t txPin);
```

###```MBusCom.begin();```
start the Serial communication

###```MBusCom.normalize(byte address);```
set the bus back

###```MBusCom.set_address(byte oldaddress, byte newaddress);```
change the M-Bus address of a slave. Use 254 as oldaddress to change a single slave with unknown address.

###```MBusCom.request_data(byte address)```
Request RSP_UD telegrams. (Slave data records)

###```MBusCom.get_response(byte *pdata, unsigned char len_pdata);```
Get the slave response from the rx buffer.

###```MBusCom.clearRXbuffer();```
Clears the rx buffer, if some junk received
