## Documentation

The **MBusCom** library enables Arduino devices to communicate with M-Bus Slaves thru a M-Bus Master (level converter) at the Data Link Layer

Tested at ESPs, Arduino Mega, MKR and Raspberry Pico but should work with all kind of ÂµCs.

Together with the [**MBusinoLib**](https://github.com/Zeppelin500/MBusinoLib), you can build a M-Bus Master for reading out M-Bus Slaves.

## API

### Class: MBusCom

Include and instantiate the MBusCom class. The constructor takes the Serial Interface and UART Pins.

```MBusCom(HardwareSerial *MbusSerial, uint8_t rxPin, uint8_t txPin);```

or

```MBusCom(Serial1 *MbusSerial);```


### begin
```MBusCom.begin();```

start the Serial communication

### normalize
```MBusCom.normalize(byte address);```

set the bus back

### set_address
```MBusCom.set_address(byte oldaddress, byte newaddress);```

change the M-Bus address of a slave. Use 254 as oldaddress to change a single slave with unknown address.

### request_data
```MBusCom.request_data(byte address)```

Request RSP_UD telegrams. (Slave data records)

### get_response
```MBusCom.get_response(byte *pdata, unsigned char len_pdata);```

Get the slave response from the rx buffer.

### clearRXbuffer
```MBusCom.clearRXbuffer();```

Clears the rx buffer, if some junk received
